    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1 heaped Tbsp hot chilli powder</li>
        <li>500g lean minced beef</li>
        <li>400g can chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 large onion</li>
        <li>1 red pepper</li>
        <li>410g can red kidney beans</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Chop pepper and remove the stalk. Peel and chop 2 garlic cloves.</li>
        <li>Cut 1 red pepper in half lengthways, remove stalk and wash the seeds away, then chop. Peel and finely chop 2 garlic cloves.</li>
        <li>Start cooking. Put your pan on the hob over a medium heat. Add 1 tbsp oil and leave it for 1-2 minutes until hot (a little longer for an electric hob).</li>
        <li>Add the onion and cook, stirring fairly frequently, for about 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft, squidgy and slightly translucent.</li>
        <li>Tip in the garlic, red pepper, 1 heaped tsp hot chilli powder or 1 level tbsp mild chilli powder, 1 tsp paprika and 1 tsp ground cumin.</li>
        <li>Give it a good stir, then leave it to cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Brown 500g lean minced beef. Turn the heat up a bit, add the meat to the pan and break it up with your spoon or spatula. The mix should sizzle a bit when you add the mince.</li>
        <li>Keep stirring and prodding for at least 5 minutes, until all the mince is in uniform, mince-sized lumps and there are no more pink bits. Make sure you keep the heat hot enough for the meat to fry and become brown, rather than just stew.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce. Crumble 1 beef stock cube into 300ml hot water. Pour this into the pan with the mince mixture.</li>
        <li>Add a 400g can of chopped tomatoes. Tip in ½ tsp dried marjoram, 1 tsp sugar and add a good shake of salt and pepper. Squirt in about 2 tbsp tomato purée and stir the sauce well.</li>
    </ol>
